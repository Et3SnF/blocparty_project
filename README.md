# BlocParty

_This is a bloc.io project Android application. (Compatibility: Android 4.4 to 6.0)_

#### About: 

* This is an all-in-one photo application where the user utilizes their social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) photos into one application. 
* The user is greeted with a feed of photos their friends uploaded to their respective network. On each photo post, the user gets to like a post and download that post image as well. 
* If the user wants to upload something exciting in their life, they can use the integrated camera in the application to take a photo, caption it, and upload it to their social network(s) of choice. They could also save the photo if they would like before uploading it as well.
